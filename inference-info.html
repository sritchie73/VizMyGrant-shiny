  <strong>Note:</strong> Sex was inferred by title or using historical data
  from the U.S. Social Security Administration baby name database from the years 
  1932 through 2012 using the
  <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/gender">R Gender package</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Career stage was inferred based on title, then by fellowship type as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Early Career:</strong> where the individual's title is Mr, Mrs, 
      Miss, Ms, or Dr; or a Grant Type containing "Early Career Fellowship";
      or a Grant Sub Type ending with "ECF".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mid Career:</strong> where the individual's title is "Associate 
      Professor", or a Grant Type containing "Career Development Fellowship", or 
      a Grant Sub Type ending with "CDF".
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Senior:</strong> where the individual's title is "Professor", or
      "Emiritus Professor", or a Grant Type of "NHMRC Partnership" or a 
      Grant Sub Type containing "Research Fellowship".
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
